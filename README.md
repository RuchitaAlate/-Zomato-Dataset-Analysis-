# Zomato Dataset Analysis 
**Project Description:**

In this project, I analyzed restaurant ratings and cuisine preferences based on consumer reviews on Zomato using R programming. The aim was to identify the top-rated dishes and popular cuisines in various locations, helping users make informed decisions about where and what to eat. By exploring the relationship between ratings and cuisine types, I identified patterns and preferences that guide consumers toward highly recommended dining experiences. The analysis also focused on ensuring that the top restaurants provided good value for money, combining quality with reasonable pricing to enhance the overall dining experience.
